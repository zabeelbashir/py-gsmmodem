Description: python-gsmmodem is a module that allows easy control of a GSM modem attached
        to the system. It also includes a couple of useful commandline utilities for
        interacting with a GSM modem.
        
        Its features include:
        - simple methods for sending SMS messages, checking signal level, etc
        - easy-to-use API for starting and responding to USSD sessions and making voice calls
        - handling incoming phone calls and received SMS messages via callback methods
        - support for SMS PDU and text mode
        - support for tracking SMS status reports
        - wraps AT command errors into Python exceptions by default
        - modular design; you easily issue your own AT commands to the modem with error
          (with error checking), or read/write directly from/to the modem if you prefer
        - comprehensive test suite
        
        Bundled utilities:
        - GSMTerm: an easy-to-use serial terminal for communicating with an attached GSM
          modem. It features command completion, built-in help for many AT commands,
          history, context-aware prompt, etc.
        - sendsms.py: a simple command line script to send SMS messages
        - identify-modem.py: simple utility to identify attached modem. Can also be used to
          provide debug information used for development of python-gsmmodem.
